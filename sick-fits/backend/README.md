# Environment Setup

In order to keep environment keys private and out of repo, I am using a .env file stored in my personal GDrive acct.

In GDrive, the .env is stored in Self/Projects/Coding/bosAR/.env

To add it to this folder run the following command in the backend directory:

```sh
ln -s /<path to GDrive on local>/Self/Projects/Coding/bosAR/.env .env
```
